exercise 2:
    In 2a i overflow the ret address of http_serve.
    In 2b i overwrite the handler function pointer which can be called by http_serve.   

exercise 3:
   Some can some cannot.For example,the last one which overflow an address on code segment which can not be used in this execieses.

exercies 5:

1. The attacker can access the files on the server based on the fact the serve donot check the .. symbols in request path.(The http_serve function only use a strcat(dir,name) to combine the name.Because usually the server's directory is known to the public so the attacker can get the files.
   You can explicit check the name when passed it to http_serve.
   The limitations is that you gotta know what you are looking for and excatly where they are.

2. You can use a non-exesists file to the server,the server will return the path where the server exesists.The attacker can use this path to make attacks described above.
   You can donot print the full name of path to the client.
   The limitation is that it must be worked combined with the vulnibalities above.
